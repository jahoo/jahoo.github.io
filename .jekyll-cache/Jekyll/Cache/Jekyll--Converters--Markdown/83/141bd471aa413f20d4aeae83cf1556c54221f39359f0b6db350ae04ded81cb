I"ì<p>I gave a syntax talk at <a href="https://wccfl2020.linguistics.ubc.ca/">WCCFL 38</a> at UBC, titled <em>Accounting for variation in number agreement in Icelandic DAT-NOM constructions</em>.  The proposal uses the feature gluttony mechanism of Coon and Keine (an agreement mechanism wherein \(\varphi\)-probes can enter into agree relationships with multiple goals) to derive reported interspeaker variation in number agreement. The handout is <a href="/assets/wccfl2020.pdf">here</a>.</p>
