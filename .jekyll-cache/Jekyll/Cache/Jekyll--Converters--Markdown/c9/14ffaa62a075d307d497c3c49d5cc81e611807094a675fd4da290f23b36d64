I"q<p>I gave a syntax talk at <a href="https://wccfl2020.linguistics.ubc.ca/">WCCFL 38</a>, at UBC, titled <em>Accounting for variation in number agreement in Icelandic DAT-NOM constructions</em>.</p>

<p>Basically, when they’re using certain specific verbs that don’t agree with their subjects, some Icelandic speakers let the verb agree with the object, and others don’t, and this seems to depend a little bit on word order.  My proposal is an attempt to provide a concrete mechanism to explain these differences. The proposal uses the feature gluttony mechanism of <a href="https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004224">Coon and Keine 2019</a> (an agreement mechanism wherein \(\varphi\)-probes can enter into agree relationships with multiple goals) to derive reported interspeaker variation in number agreement.</p>

<p>The handout is <a href="/assets/wccfl2020.pdf">here</a>.</p>
