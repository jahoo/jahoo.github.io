## Preliminaries

Bundler is useful to reduce errors and keep things clean (first you have to have ruby installed):

```
gem install bundler
```

Install jekyll and other necessary dependencies (this should work without any preparation on macOS, for errors on Windows see [here](https://github.com/juthilo/run-jekyll-on-windows)):

```
gem install github-pages
```


This will install jekyll, sass, etc.  Next, find a jekyll theme you like (see [here](https://jekyllthemes.io/free) or [here](https://jekyll-themes.com/free/) for a curated list).  For instance, use  gaalcaras/[academic](https://jekyll-themes.com/academic/).
