I gave a syntax talk at [WCCFL 38](https://wccfl2020.linguistics.ubc.ca/), at UBC in Vancouver, titled *Accounting for variation in number agreement in Icelandic DAT-NOM constructions*.  

Basically, when they're using certain specific verbs that don't agree with their subjects, some Icelandic speakers let the verb agree with the object, and others don't, and this seems to depend a little bit on word order.  My proposal is an attempt to provide a concrete mechanism to explain these differences. The proposal uses the feature gluttony mechanism of [Coon and Keine 2020](https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004224) (an agreement mechanism wherein \\(\varphi\\)-probes can enter into agree relationships with multiple goals) to derive reported interspeaker variation in number agreement.
