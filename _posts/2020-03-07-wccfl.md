title: Icelandic agreement talk - WCCFL 38
published: true 
---

I gave a syntax talk at [WCCFL 38](https://wccfl2020.linguistics.ubc.ca/) at UBC, titled *Accounting for variation in number agreement in Icelandic DAT-NOM constructions*.  The proposal uses the feature gluttony mechanism of Coon and Keine (an agreement mechanism wherein \(\varphi\)-probes can enter into agree relationships with multiple goals) to derive reported interspeaker variation in number agreement. The handout is [here](/assets/wccfl2020.pdf).
