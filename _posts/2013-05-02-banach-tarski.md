The Banach-Tarski paradox is a curious theorem from group theory. I was quite taken by it when I first learned of it, and wrote up [these self-contained notes (PDF)](/assets/pdfs/2013.05.02-banach-tarski.pdf). 

Banach-Tarski shows _how to conjure things out of thin air_ ...but not with magic, just with the [axiom of choice](https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice). You also need an infinitely divisible object, but only on short loan, because after you cut it up and reassemble it, you'll have two!.  Basically, it gives a method for taking a ball, cutting it up into many tiny pieces, and then putting the pieces back together to make two balls just identical the one you started with.
