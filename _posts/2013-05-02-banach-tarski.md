A while ago I wrote up these notes describing the Banach-Tarski "paradox". 

Banach-Tarski shows _how to conjure things out of thin air_ ...with the axiom of choice (you also need an infinitely divisible object, but only on short loan, because after you cut it up and reassemble it, you'll have two!).  Basically, it gives a method for taking a ball, cutting it up into pieces, and putting the pieces back together to make two balls just identical the one you started with.
