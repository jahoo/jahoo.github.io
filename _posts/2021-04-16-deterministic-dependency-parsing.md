I made a simple flipbook animation of deterministic dependency parsing algorithms examples from [Nivre (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1162/coli.07-056-R1-07-027), using [`beamer`](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer), because apparently I'm living in 2006.  

<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="/assets/2021-04-16-deterministic-dependency-parsing.pdf"><img width="600" src="/assets/2021-04-16-deterministic-dependency-parsing-example.png"></a></div><br/>

The [PDF here](/assets/2021-04-16-deterministic-dependency-parsing.pdf) is meant to be viewed in presentation mode / single-page view. The LaTeX code is [in this zip file](/assets/2021-04-deterministic-dependency-parsing.zip), in case that's useful to anyone.
