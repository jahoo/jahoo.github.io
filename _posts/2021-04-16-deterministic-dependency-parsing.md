Here is a [simple (beamer) animation](/assets/2021-04-16-deterministic-dependency-parsing.pdf) of deterministic dependency parsing algorithms examples from [Nivre (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1162/coli.07-056-R1-07-027).  PDF is meant to be displayed in single-page view / presentation mode. TeX code is [here](/assets/2021-04-deterministic-dependency-parsing.zip), in case that's useful to anyone.
