title: Y combinator in clojure
published: true

Here's testing out using [klipse](https://github.com/viebel/klipse) to make interactive code boxes.

### Learning about clojure and combinators


```eval-clojure

(defn almost-factorial [f]
    (fn [n]
      (if (= n 0)
          1
          (* n (f (- n 1))))))

(def factorialA (almost-factorial factorialA))
```

doesn't work (because clojure is not lazy?)
gives `Attempting to call unbound fn: #'user/factorialA`

anyway so, how about:
```eval-clojure
(defn fixPt [f]
  (f (fixPt f)))
```

this will also not work,
because this isn't a combinator: there is an unbound Y

so...

```eval-clojure
(defn Y?
  [f]
  (fn [x]
    ((Y? f) x)))
((Y? almost-factorial) 3)
```
still doesn't work because Y is still not a combinator.

this is what we need:

```eval-clojure
(def Y
  (fn [f]
    ((fn [x] (x x))
     (fn [x] (f (fn [y] ((x x) y)))))))
```

should work, right?

```eval-clojure
((Y almost-factorial) 3)
```

Yes.
```eval-clojure
(def fact (Y almost-factorial))

(fact 3)
```

works!
