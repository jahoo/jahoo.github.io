I gave a presentation to [MCQLL](https://mcqll.org/), on an an example of the duality of generative systems and constraint-based systems.  The particular example I discussed was a proof of the equivalence in expressive power between Finite state automata (FSA) and monadic second order logic (with a successor function; MSOL[_S_]).  That is, I presented the proof that any language for which there exists an FSA can be described equivalently using constraints written in MSOL[_S_].
