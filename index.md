Hi. [I](/assets/j.png)’m a PhD student in [linguistics at McGill University](https://mcgill.ca/linguistics/) and [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/). My advisor is [Tim O'Donnell](https://todonnell.github.io/), and I'm a member of the [Montreal Computational & Quantitative Linguistics Lab](https://mcqll.org/).  I'm interested in lots of things, but currently I am focusing on psycholinguistic theories of human language processing, using information theory, algorithmic complexity results, and tools from machine learning. I want to understand what human and machine learning can tell us about the underlying structure and complexity of language.  Human language is complicated, yet we learn to use is expertly and fluently without trying. …How do we do that? 🤔 

I just noticed there's a typo in the above paragraph. That illustrates another question I am currently interested in: How come typos and more generally production errors/imprecision don't hinder understanding more than they do?

I'm also a professional ballet dancer, formerly with [Festival Ballet Providence](http://www.festivalballetprovidence.org) (now Ballet RI) in Rhode Island, The [Vanemuine Theatre](https://www.vanemuine.ee) in Tartu, Estonia, and José Mateo Ballet Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  I still try to dance as much as I can.
