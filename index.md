Hi. [I](/assets/j2024.jpeg)â€™m Jacob. I am a postdoctoral fellow at MIT's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, working with [Roger Levy](https://www.mit.edu/~rplevy/), in the [Computational Psycholinguistics Laboratory](http://cpl.mit.edu/). In Summer 2024, I finished my PhD at McGill University in [ Linguistics](https://mcgill.ca/linguistics/), under the supervision of [Tim O'Donnell](https://todonnell.github.io/), where I was a member of the [Montreal Computational & Quantitative Linguistics Lab](https://mcqll.org/) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/) â€“ Quebec AI Institute.

I'm interested in lots of things, but currently I am focusing on psycholinguistic theories of human language processing, using information theory, algorithmic complexity results, and tools from machine learning. I want to understand what human and machine learning can tell us about the underlying structure and complexity of language.  Human language is complicated, yet we learn to use is expertly and fluently without trying. â€¦How do we do that? ðŸ¤” 

I just noticed there's a typo in the above paragraph. That illustrates another question I am currently interested in: How come typos and more generally production errors/imprecision don't hinder understanding more than they do?

I'm also a (mostly retired) professional ballet dancer, formerly with Festival Ballet Providence (now [Ballet RI](https://balletri.org/)) in Rhode Island, The [Vanemuine Theatre](https://www.vanemuine.ee) in Tartu, Estonia, and JosÃ© Mateo Ballet Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
