Hi. [I](/assets/j2024.jpeg)’m Jacob. Some things I'm interested in are human language processing and inference algorithms. My research builds on probabilistic models of cognition, using information theory, algorithmic complexity, and tools from linguistics and machine learning. 

In my current position I research and coordinate at [CHI FRO](https://chi-fro.org/), and I am part of the [GenLM](https://genlm.org/) research consortium. Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at MIT's [Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences](https://bcs.mit.edu), working with [Roger Levy](https://www.mit.edu/~rplevy/), in the [Computational Psycholinguistics Laboratory](http://cpl.mit.edu/). I completed my PhD in [Linguistics at McGill](https://mcgill.ca/linguistics/) University, under the supervision of [Tim O'Donnell](https://todonnell.github.io/), where I was a member of the [Montreal Computational & Quantitative Linguistics Lab](https://mcqll.org/) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/) – Quebec AI Institute.

I'm also a dancer, formerly with Festival Ballet Providence (now [Ballet RI](https://balletri.org/)) in Rhode Island, The [Vanemuine Theatre](https://www.vanemuine.ee) in Tartu, Estonia, and José Mateo Ballet Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
