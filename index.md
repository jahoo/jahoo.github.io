I'm a PhD student in [linguistics at McGill University](https://mcgill.ca/linguistics/) and [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/), where I'm advised by [Tim O'Donnell](http://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~timothy.odonnell/).  I'm a member of the [Montreal Computational & Quantitative Linguistics Lab](https://mcqll.org/).  I'm interested in lots of things, but most of all logic, mathematical linguistics, [information theory](http://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf), and the generative / expressive capacity of formal systems. I want to understand what human and machine learning can tell us about the underlying structure and complexity of the human language system.

CV [here](/assets/jlh-academic_cv.pdf).

I'm also a ballet dancer, formerly with [Festival Ballet Providence](http://www.festivalballetprovidence.org) in Rhode Island, The [Vanemuine Theatre](https://www.vanemuine.ee/people/jacob-hoover/?lang=en) in Tartu, Estonia, and Jos√© Mateo Ballet Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
