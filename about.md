I'm a graduate student in [linguistics](https://mcgill.ca/linguistics/) McGill University, in the [Montreal Computational & Quantitative Linguistics Lab](http://mcqll.org/JacobHoover.About).  I'm interested in logic, mathematical linguistics, and the generative / expressive capacity of formal systems.  Of course, I'm still figuring it out, but you know... those kinds of things.

I'm also a ballet dancer.
