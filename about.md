I'm a graduate student in [linguistics at McGill University](https://mcgill.ca/linguistics/), in the [Montreal Computational & Quantitative Linguistics Lab](http://mcqll.org/JacobHoover.About), under [Tim O'Donnell](http://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~timothy.odonnell/).  I'm interested in logic, mathematical linguistics, and the generative / expressive capacity of formal systems, as well as information theory, and exploring what both human and machine learning might be able to tell us about the underlying structure of language.

I'm also a ballet dancer, formerly with [Festival Ballet Providence](http://www.festivalballetprovidence.org) in RI, The [Vanemuine Theatre](https://www.vanemuine.ee/people/jacob-hoover/?lang=en) in Estonia, and Jos√© Mateo Ballet Theatre in Cambridge MA.
